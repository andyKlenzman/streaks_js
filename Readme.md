# Streaks_JS
a minimal habit tracker web app with MVC and Firebase backend.

I created a minimalist habit tracker inspired by “streak” apps like snapchat, but stripped of cluttered UIs and extra features. I built it in raw JavaScript with an Model-View-Controller architecture and connected it to Firebase, adding a data access layer, which implements one API for connecting to multiple data sources.
